type make
RUN: ./oss
HELP: ./oss -h

output goes to file named 'logfile' 
the name of logfile can be changed using -l command
-----------------------------------------------------

updated oss.c file for setting up a semaphore,
still need to add semaphore ID and the Permissions 
to the node.h file for shared access.
getopt is complete, as well as printing run settings. 
most vars are declared. 

-----------------------------------------------------

updating node.h file to include structs for shared
memory: clock, resourcesDescriptors, resourceRequests, 
and allocation attempts.
Also added alarm function to oss.c
----------------------------------------------------
for loop started for main resource mgmt algorithm.
need to add deadlock detection and finish main while loop.
also - updated node.h to include a couple more vars in 
the structs for requests.
----------------------------------------------------
I finished the main while loop for memory mgmt. Still
need to implement the deadlock alg. Moving onto user.c, 
then will update the deadlock. want to test it runs before
worrying about the deadlock part.
